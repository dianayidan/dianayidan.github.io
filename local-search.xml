    <title>The Uk&#39;s Political system</title>
    <link href="/2022/09/23/UK_political_system/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><u>Summary:</u> </p><p>The British political system is a two-party system and in order to measure a country’s political stability, we can look at the indicator of the political stability index. The latest data from 2020 shows that the UK scores 0.47 which proves that the UK has a relatively stable government compared with the average level in the world. The 2022 International IP shows the UK has ranked No.2 out of the 55 economies which indicates that the UK has a mature law and supervision system to continue to promote and develop the intellectual property market. The fundamental principles of business culture in the United Kingdom are courtesy, politeness, discipline, and punctuality and most British businesspeople are following a rational and pragmatic approach.</p><p><strong>C: Political system</strong></p><p><strong>Political structure:</strong> Britain is a constitutional monarchy governed by a king or a queen and it is also a parliamentary democracy whose government is controlled by a parliament that has been elected by the people. The highest positions in the government are filled by the members of the directly elected parliament.</p><p><strong>Political parties:</strong> The British political system is a two-party system. Since the 1920s, the two dominant parties have been the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. In September of 2022, Liz Truss became the new prime minister of the UK after meeting the queen at Balmoral. Her first significant act as prime minister is to deal with the high price of energy and made it affordable to the people of the UK. </p><p>Stability of the government: To measure a country’s political stability, we can look at the indicator of the political stability index. It ranges in degree from -2.5 meaning unstable to +2.5 which means stable. The given data shows from the year 1996 to 2020, the average value for the United Kingdom was 0.48. With a minimum of 0.08 points in 2018 and a maximum of 1.04 points in 2000. In the latest data from 2020, the world average value based on 194 countries is -0.07, and the UK scores 0.47 (Bank, 2020).  The compared result proves that the UK has a relatively stable government with better performance than the average level in the world. A general conclusion can be obtained through this observation from the British government. The stable political environment is of great opportunity to expand our market in this country.</p><p><strong>Special taxes in the UK:</strong></p><p>In 2021/22, the UK government raised over £915 billion a year in receipts – income from taxes and other sources. This is equivalent to around 39% of the size of the UK economy, as measured by GDP. In cash terms, the hardest hit tax in 2020/21 was VAT, where receipts were over £17 billion lower, compared with 2019/20. Consumers were less able to go out and spend during the pandemic, and Government policies, such as cutting VAT from 20% to 5% for the ‘hospitality, accommodation, and attractions sector, have also affected VAT receipt (Matthew, 2022).  </p><p>For example, the carbon tax. A Carbon tax aims to make individuals and firms pay the full social cost of carbon pollution. This special tax will encourage individuals to reduce pollution and encourage them to use more environmentally products such as solar power. It also makes polluters pay the external cost of carbon emissions. In contrast, there exist some problems, for example, enterprises may avoid paying carbon tax by secretly polluting the greenhouse gases in the environment (Pettinger, 2020 ). Under this scenario, the government should strengthen education on ethical behavior and set guidelines and regulations for the people to follow.</p><p><strong>Local government:</strong> Normally, Government is responsible for deciding how the country is run, they set taxes, and deciding how to best deliver public services such as the National Health Service, and welfare benefits such as the state pension. In the United Kingdom, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their devolved governments and each with varying powers. The parliament’s job is to look closely at the Government’s plans and to monitor the way they are running things, they work on behalf of the government’s decision by examining new proposals closely and suggesting improvements, checking how public money is being spent, and tracking how new laws are working out in practice (Parliament, 2022). </p><p><strong>D: Legal system</strong></p><p><strong>Judiciary system:</strong> The UK does not have a constitution that is contained in a written constitutional instrument. It is to be found in the statutes passed by Parliament and in the common law, which developed over historical reasons. As a state made up of several separate jurisdictions, the United Kingdom does not have a single unified legal system. The UK lacks a written constitution on the current political and legal institutions, also their institutions did not separate the functions and powers of the three different branches of the state which are the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary (Judiciary, 2022). </p><p>For example, the government is made up of MPs and peers who are also members of the legislature including the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The UK public elects 650 Members of Parliament to represent their interests and concerns in the House of Commons. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It plays a crucial role in examining bills, questioning government action, and investigating public policy. In this case, it is usually quite intricate and requires some time to make a unified decision or pass through the law such as the Brexit issue. If a company wants to do business in the UK it would be better to choose a time after the factionalism.</p><p><strong>Intellectual property</strong>: IP usually gives the creator an exclusive right over the use of his creation for a certain period. Copyright, patents, designs, and trademarks are common rights for intellectual property protection. 179 countries have signed up to the Berne Convention which lays down a common framework and agreement between nations concerning intellectual property rights. The 2022 International IP Index published by the US Chamber of Commerce has given out the rankings and the indicators of the overall score of IP. The UK has ranked No.2 out of the 55 economies. It has a high ranking in the sector of copyright and trademark and a relatively lower ranking in the patents and design rights (commerce, 2022). Copyright law originated in the United Kingdom from a concept of common law which is the Statute of Anne 1709. It became statutory with the passing of the Copyright Act of 1911. The current act is the Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act 1988(service, 2022). The UK has a mature law and supervision system to continue to promote and develop the intellectual property market. </p><p><strong>E: Social Organization</strong></p><p><strong>Group behavior:</strong> Social organization refers to the network of relationships in a group and how they interconnect with each other. For example, Social Value UK is a Joint Member Network of Social Value International, the global standard-setting organization for social value and impact management. Social Value International has also partnered with the UNDP and SDG Impact to support the adoption of the SDG Impact Standards globally. Social Value UK’s mission is to change the way society accounts for value through principles, practice, people, and power and develop guidance, tools, and support to help achieve the principles. Businesses can make a cooperation with these organizations and achieve common goals to enhance customers’ favorability and their reputation. </p><p><strong>The UK social classes:</strong> </p><p>Approximated Social Grade with its six categories A, B, C1, C2, D, and E is a socio-economic classification produced by the ONS (UK Office for National Statistics) by applying an algorithm developed by members of the MRS Census &amp; Geodemographics Group. It applies to every Household Reference Person (HRP) aged 16 to 64 (Geographics, 2014). </p><table><thead><tr><th>Social Grade</th><th>Description</th><th>% HRP population (UK)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AB</td><td>Higher &amp; intermediate managerial,  administrative, professional occupations</td><td>22.17</td></tr><tr><td>C1</td><td>Supervisory, clerical &amp; junior managerial,  administrative, professional occupations</td><td>30.84</td></tr><tr><td>C2</td><td>Skilled manual occupations</td><td>20.94</td></tr><tr><td>DE</td><td>Semi-skilled &amp; unskilled manual occupations,  Unemployed and lowest grade occupations</td><td>26.05</td></tr></tbody></table><p>From the data in the table, we can tell more than half of the proportion of people in the UK are in the middle class and above. It is clear for the company to target its customer to a specific group of social classes.</p><p><strong>Clubs:</strong> The Equality Act 2010 brings together harmonizes, in some respects extends previous equality laws. It aims to make it more consistent, clearer, and easier to follow, to make society fairer. The Act protects people from discrimination based on protected characteristics. Examples of associations include private clubs such as golf and other sports clubs, ex-forces clubs, alumni clubs, social clubs, working men’s clubs, gaming clubs, and drinking clubs. Some charities also meet the definition of an association, for example, the Scout Association and Girlguiding UK. Such charities are also subject to additional provisions relating to the provision of charitable benefits.</p><p><strong>Subcultures:</strong> Since 2001, the foreign-born share of the population has doubled to about nine million. Meanwhile, the number of those from an ethnic minority background, including ‘White Other’, has more than doubled to over 13 million, their share of the population rising from 10% to 21%. Just over one-third of all births now involve at least one foreign-born parent and one in three pupils in English state-funded schools are from an ethnic minority background. The (UK, 2021) Gaming and non-mainstream religious groups are the two leading subcultures in the UK today, according to research that highlights the value to marketers of tapping into niche cultural groups. (WARC, 2020) Overall, 73% connect with subcultures virtually. And of those online-only connectors, two-thirds are younger (67% are under 44) and are more likely to connect to gaming, body modification, fandom, and influencer subcultures. YouTube is the main platform for contact (38%) and Facebook communities remain at the heart of subculture involvement. Understanding the subcultures can be useful for the business to understand and better adapt to the local market.</p><p><strong>F: Business customs and practices</strong></p><p>The fundamental principles of business culture in the United Kingdom are courtesy, politeness, discipline, and punctuality. Most British businesspeople are following a rational and pragmatic approach. Only on rare occasions, a commitment is announced right away, while agreements need to be formalized in writing. Due to the high frequency of meetings, people working in an office environment are often away from their desks. (Expatica, 2022) This accounts for the comparatively high number of memos sent and received in a UK company. So, we need to arrange appointments in advance. Dress codes in the UK are still comparatively strict. Colleagues appreciate a sense of fashion and quality. While men wear suits, ties, and striped or colored shirts and black shoes while women wear suits with trousers or skirts or normally in dresses, often with high heels. In most companies, colleagues enjoy an after-work drink together on a Friday night. Apart from this custom, the tendency is to keep work and private life strictly separated. Invitations to someone’s private home are gestures of affection and sympathy, which is uncommon between mere business partners. Colleagues exchange business cards before or at the beginning of a meeting. A card usually displays someone’s job title, first and surname. Academic titles are not necessarily on a business card unless they are relevant to your work. It is essentially important to understand its local customs when doing business with the British people. </p><p><strong>Reference:</strong></p><p>Bank, T. W.
