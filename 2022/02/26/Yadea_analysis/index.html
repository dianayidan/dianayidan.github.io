<h2 id="The-Marketing-Plan"><a href="#The-Marketing-Plan" class="headerlink" title="The Marketing Plan:"></a><strong>The Marketing Plan:</strong></h2><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Yadea-Y1S targets the high-end market for the businessman to use and it is important to find the right customer in a short time. The UK market has the potential to grow in the future but to gain a competitive advantage in the market share, the company needs to expand its retail shops in the UK to attract more customers who the interests in using the electric motor car in life. Besides that, marketing techniques for example using coupons and personal selling will be helpful as well. Through estimation Yadea’s profit in 2022 in the UK market is expected to be <strong>40,834,256RMB</strong>. To maximize the probability of achieving this target, the company can use the SWOT analysis to know that as a listed company its strength is the strong research and development team and its weakness is the limited speed and the product outlook, its opportunity is the trend of the green transportation, and the threat is the international competitors and the political risk and policies that will affect the operation abroad. The product advantages and features are the large battery capacity and the intelligent Battery Management System, it is also dedicated to providing sustainable customer service together with its distributor partners. Our Wish is to increase Yadea’s leadership role in the industry, by creating a new generation that’s identified by a green commuting lifestyle. </p>
<h3 id="A-Marketing-objectives"><a href="#A-Marketing-objectives" class="headerlink" title="A. Marketing objectives"></a>A. Marketing objectives</h3><ol>
<li><p>Target market: Yadea-Y1S is suitable for commercial use, and it targets customers for businessmen and freelancers. The life cycle of the product is short as it belongs to a specialty good. Thus, it is of great importance to advertising our products to the exact consumers in a limited period.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sales forecast years 1-5: The UK market has the potential to grow in the future due to the trend of the green transportation. We estimate the sales by using the forecast revenue from 2022 to 2026.  And divided by 26000RMB (3500 euro) for a single price of the Yadea-Y1S. We will probably sold 1570 electric-scooters in 2022 in the UK market.</p>

<p>Figure 2- Sales Forecast from 2022 to 2026</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Profit forecast years 1-5: Currently, over 90% of the Group’s revenue and operating profit were generated from the sale of electric vehicles in the PRC. In the total revenue for electric scooters, we counted 2% total sales of the market share in the UK and 20% for the revenue of Yadea Y1S (10,208,564,000 * 2%* 20%) will be <strong>40,834,256RMB.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/yadea/Revenue_forecast_Yadea_Y1S.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="Revenue forecast Yadea Y1S"></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Market penetration and coverage: Moreover, with the emergence of demand for personalized green micro-mobility, continuous upgrade of electric two-wheeled vehicles, and diversification of product applications, the customer base will continue to expand. Further coupled with the sustainable replacement demand brought by the growing penetration of two-wheeled vehicles, the two-wheeled vehicles industry enjoys an optimistic outlook.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="B-SWOT-Analysis"><a href="#B-SWOT-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="B.  SWOT Analysis"></a>B.  SWOT Analysis</h3><ol>
<li><p>Strengths: The Group had an annual electric two-wheeled vehicle production capacity of approximately 17 million units, supported by more than 9,000 employees. Accelerated technological innovations and advances - It also has a strong research and development team based in Shanghai and Wuxi with 906 research and development professionals with various product design backgrounds for electric two-wheeled vehicles. Also, the Company was listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong which will increase its financing capital for its operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Weaknesses: The Business Model of Yadea Group can be easily imitated by competitors in the Recreational Products industry. To overcome these challenges company needs to build a platform model that can integrate suppliers, vendors, and end users. Also, the speed is limited to 45 km/h, and the outlook is not sporty. There is also a lack of charging stations in the UK.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Opportunities: Advocating for green traveling which retard the climate change issues. The launch of the Y1S comes as more countries introduce policies to promote the use of electric two-wheelers. According to the UNEP, a global shift to 90% electric two- and three-wheelers by 2030 will reduce CO2 emissions by 11 billion tons between now and 2050.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Threats: Competitors catching up with the product development - Even though at present the Yadea Group is still the leader in product innovation in the Recreational Products segment. It is facing stiff challenges from international and local competitors. The changing policy and the external political risk might affect the operation in the UK; thus the managers have to follow up with the macroeconomics of the society to adjust its marketing strategy.</p>
